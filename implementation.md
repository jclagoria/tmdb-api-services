API Service Development with Java 21 and Quarkus
1. Application Overview
The application will interact with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to manage account-related operations, including:

Retrieving and updating account details.
Handling watchlists, favorites, and ratings.
Secure API interaction using Bearer Token authentication.
2. Design Patterns
Builder Pattern: To construct dynamic API requests (e.g., headers, query parameters, and body payloads).
Factory Method Pattern: Encapsulates the creation of REST clients for modularity and ease of maintenance.
Decorator Pattern: Adds logging, monitoring, or retries to API requests dynamically.
Repository Pattern: Organizes API logic into a consistent structure, abstracting TMDB API calls.
Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of the HTTP client is used for optimal resource management.
Circuit Breaker Pattern: Enhances resilience by managing failed API call thresholds and temporarily halting requests when necessary.
3. Caching Strategy
Purpose: Reduces redundant API calls and improves performance.
Implementation:
Use Quarkus' caching extension for in-memory caching.
Caches TMDB API responses with configurable expiration.
Configuration:
Example: Account details cached with @CacheResult and custom expiration policies.
4. Fault Tolerance
Circuit Breaker: Ensures service resilience during API failures by:
Defining request volume and failure thresholds.
Temporarily halting API calls to an unresponsive endpoint.
Implementation:
Enabled using @CircuitBreaker annotation from SmallRye Fault Tolerance.
Configurable delay and failure ratio for better fault tolerance.
5. Health Monitoring
Liveness Checks: Verifies that the application is operational.
Readiness Checks: Ensures the service is ready to handle requests by:
Checking TMDB API availability.
Verifying database or external service connections.
Endpoints:
/q/health/live for liveness.
/q/health/ready for readiness.
6. Recommended Dependencies
Core Framework: Quarkus RESTEasy Reactive for REST endpoints.
JSON Handling: Quarkus JSON-B.
Fault Tolerance: Quarkus SmallRye Fault Tolerance.
Caching: Quarkus Cache.
Health Monitoring: Quarkus SmallRye Health.
7. Quarkus-Specific Features
Reactive Programming: Supports non-blocking I/O for high-performance API interactions.
Dev Services: Facilitates local testing and quick iteration during development.
Configuration Profiles: Custom settings for API keys, cache policies, and fault tolerance parameters.
8. Architecture Recommendations
Modularize the application into:
API Layer: Handles TMDB API interactions.
Service Layer: Manages business logic and caching.
Health Checks: Monitors service health and readiness.
Include robust exception handling and logging.
9. Advantages of Proposed Architecture
Improved performance with caching.
Enhanced resilience with circuit breaker integration.
Proactive monitoring with health checks.
Modular design ensures maintainability and scalability.
